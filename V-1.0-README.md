# Instructions to Download
- Must have installed: python3, smtplib, email & ssl.
- If you don't know how to install them, you can just input the following codes in your terminal:
- pip install smptlib ssl email --break-system-packages.
Then
- Open your terminal and paste this code: git clone github.com/fen0dev/CV-sender.git

# How to run it
- In your terminal, paste this: python3 send_cv.py -c /Path/To/Your/CV.pdf -e /Path/To/email_addresses.txt
OBS: The file containing the email addresses should be named: "emails.txt". (By default - it works best this way)

# INFO
This is a simple python code that saves time when it comes to applying to different jobs.
You'll have to configure the SSL server with your email account and change the subject/body of the email, within the script, to your liking and scope.
Make sure that the credentials are correct. I would suggest to try it out first on yourself and then use it for its purpose.

# UPDATES
I will update the code and make it better soon :-) I have in mind some cool features I'd like to implement.
Hope it's useful and you like it.
