# Instructions to Download
Open your terminal and paste this code: git clone github.com/fen0dev/CV-sender.git
You must have python3, smtplib, email and ssl installed. If you don't know how to install them, you can just input the following codes in your terminal: pip install smptlib --> change smptib to ssl and email.

# How to run it
In your terminal, paste this: python3 send_cv.py -c /Path/To/Your/CV.pdf -e /Path/To/email_addresses.txt

# INFO
This is a simple python code that saves time when it comes to applying to different jobs.
You'll have to configure the SSL server with your email account. Make sure that the credentials are correct. I would suggest to try it out first on yourself and then use it for its purpose.

# UPDATES
I will update the code and make it better soon :-) Hope it's useful and you like it.
